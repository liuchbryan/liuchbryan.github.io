# About the Author, in Markdown
author-about: |
  I am a data scientist. I help business teams solve their data problems and realise tangible value. Often, I do so by leading cross-functional teams to build data pipelines and statistics/machine learning models.    
      
  Over the years (mainly at [ASOS.com](https://www.asos.com)), I have built many customer models and produced sales and returns forecasts. I have also learnt how to translate between technical and business, academia and industry, and science and engineering.   
       
  In addition, I specialise in measuring the impact of business decisions via online experiments. My PhD [at Imperial and Oxford](https://statml.io/) focuses on the practical data and statistical challenges when one starts experimenting from scratch.    
      
  I am a member of the Royal Statistical Society and the [UK Global Talent / Tech Nation Visa Alumni Network](https://technation.io/global-talent-alumni/). I review academic and technical work for conferences such as AdKDD and others. I also mentor high school students seeking a tech or data science career via the [Social Mobility Foundation](https://www.socialmobility.org.uk/mentoring).
